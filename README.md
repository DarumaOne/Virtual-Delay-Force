# Virtual-Delay-Force
Research about delay force inside virtual-haptics environment.

Continuing my Visual-Haptic project, this project is my research for my master study.
I'm trying to compare the difference of force delay of Visual-Haptic application when the object is shown and hidden by using Delta for the Haptic Device. 

In order to run this application, you need:

Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 (for debug)
Oculus Rift Development Kit 2
Delta Haptic Device
